- Think carefully and only do what is asked with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little as possible.
- Generate only the files which have corresponding Output: directive. 
- Don't assume any other files besides Output: and Context: exist.
- Use ES6+ syntax with async/await and import/export.
- Use async/await with `tape` for tests.
- Don't create nested tests 
- Don't use `t.end` or `t.plan`
- Cleanup using `finally`. Don't use `catch` unless you are expecting an error.
- Use `t.capture(obj, method, implementation = () => {})`, `t.captureFn(original)` and `t.intercept(obj, property, desc = {}, strictMode = true)` as needed.
- Don't try to use `jest.mock`, we are using `tape`.
