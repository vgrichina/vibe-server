- Generate only the files which have corresponding Output: directive. 
- Don't assume any other files besides Output: and Context: exist.
- Use ES6+ syntax with async/await and import/export.
- Don't create nested tests 
- Use async/await with `tape`
- Don't use `t.end` or `t.plan`
- Cleanup using `finally`. Don't use `catch` unless you are expecting an error.
- Use `t.capture`, `t.captureFn` and `t.intercept` as needed.
