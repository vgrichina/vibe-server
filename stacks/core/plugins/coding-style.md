- Think carefully and only do what is asked with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little as possible.
- Generate only the files which have corresponding Output: directive. 
- Don't assume any other files besides Output: and Context: exist.
- Use ES6+ syntax with async/await and import/export.
- Avoid dependencies on external libraries like `openai`: just use `fetch` to make HTTP requests.
